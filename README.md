## Global Food Analysis

## Global Food Analysis Project

Welcome to the Global Food Analysis project repository!

### Overview

This project aims to analyze global food data to gain insights into consumption patterns, and potential trends. The dataset used contains information about various food items, including their production, and consumption across different countries.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Analyze global food consumption trends.
- Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
- Predict future trends in food consumption based on historical data.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations and statistical techniques are used to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into food consumption trends.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are selected and engineered to enhance predictive modeling.

5. **Modeling**: Machine learning models are trained using historical data to predict future food prices.

6. **Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their predictive accuracy.

### Results

The predictive model developed in this project achieves an accuracy of 92% in predicting future food prices.
